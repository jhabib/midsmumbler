# MIDS W251 - Mumbler

## Overview
I took a client-server approach this mumbler project. The server environment consists of three GPFS nodes cleverly named gpfs1, gpfs2 and gpfs3. I submitted the IP addresses and login info for these VSes on ISVC.

This picture probably does a better job of explaining my mumbler implementation than I ever could in my ESL.

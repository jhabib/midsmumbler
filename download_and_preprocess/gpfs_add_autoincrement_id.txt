# since I forgot to do this when running create_db.py
# I used sqlite3 gpfsN_bigrams.db to connect to each database (N: 1, 2, 3)
# And then executed the following commands
# This created an autoincrement id on the tables
# I might not need it but it's good to have this in the back pocket
# I also created indexes to speed up searches
